# myfirstyolo
This is first yolo model I trained 
I use chili leaves as an example to train the yolo, it is quite fun, but I only create two classes one is normal, and the other is lack of nitrogen.
I use anaconda environment to run it
you could watch this Youtuber to learn it https://youtu.be/ljFwYKL6-1U?si=ieuDyTyD7BdS2_xk
and python to run it
